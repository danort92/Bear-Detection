The dataset includes 1172 images.
Bears-tdL6 are annotated in YOLOv8 Oriented Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Randomly crop between 0 and 25 percent of the image
* Random shear of between -12째 to +12째 horizontally and -12째 to +12째 vertically
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.58 percent of pixels
